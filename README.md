# WeatherPy and Gmaps
Module 6 - APIs

## Overview
This project utilizes the API frameworks of Google Maps and OpenWeather to collect the weather data of random cities, plot these cities in Google Maps, and add small info boxes about the location and weather for each city. It also includes the citipy library, which has the ability to find the nearest city when given a latitude/longitude pair. This tool is used to generate the list of cities by randomly generating a list of latitude/longitude pairs and finding the nearest city.
